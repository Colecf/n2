# Snapshot tests

This directory contains real-world outputs from tools that generate Ninja files.

Because these outputs are large, they aren't checked in to the Ninja tree.
Instead there is a `snapshot.zip` stored with Git LFS.  Unpack it with

```
$ unzip snapshot.zip
```

## Test data

### llvm-cmake

`llvm-cmake/` contains LLVM build files generated by CMake.

https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html (note they have a CMake-specific page
that has instructions that don't work(?!))

```
$ cmake -G Ninja -B build -S llvm -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

### llvm-gn

`llvm-gn/` contains LLVM build files generated by the GN build system.

Read llvm/utils/gn/README.rst in LLVM checkout for more, but in brief.

```
$ llvm/utils/gn/get.py
$ llvm/utils/gn/gn.py gen out/gn
```
